## Why This Matters

Dragon's Labyrinth isn't just another indie RPG. It's a demonstration that games can still surprise us, that horror and RPG mechanics can merge meaningfully, and that procedural content can have soul. We're creating an experience where losing power creates more tension than gaining it ever could, where every hex traveled is a conscious choice toward inevitable doom, and where the real horror isn't the monster at the end—it's what you and your companions become along the way.
