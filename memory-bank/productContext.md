# Dragon's Labyrinth - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional RPGs have become predictable power fantasies where players always become stronger and threats always become manageable. Horror games often rely on jump scares and gore rather than psychological dread. There's a gap in the market for games that use RPG mechanics to deliver genuine emotional horror experiences.

### The Solution
Dragon's Labyrinth inverts the RPG power curve. Instead of growing stronger, the world grows darker. Instead of gaining confidence, players experience mounting dread. The familiar RPG structure becomes a vehicle for horror, using player investment in companions and world to deliver emotional impact when everything falls apart.

### The Innovation
- **Narrative Orchestration**: The emotional journey IS the game orchestrator
- **Inverted Power Curve**: Growing weaker as horror intensifies
- **Companion Trauma**: NPCs that genuinely break under pressure
- **Proximity Horror**: Being hunted creates real tension
- **Moral Weight**: Choices matter because they affect people you care about

## Target Experience

### Opening Moments
Player opens their front door to a beautiful morning. Birds singing, sun shining, neighbors waving. A quest to deliver bread to the next village. Everything is perfect. Too perfect.

### Mid-Game Transformation
The world literally darkens. NPCs flee. Companions question continuing. The player realizes they're not the hero of this story - they're prey. The dragon isn't a boss to defeat - it's an inevitability to face.

### Climactic Horror
Sudden shift to first-person perspective in the labyrinth. The dragon actively hunts you. Audio cues reveal proximity. Sanity mechanics create false sounds. Your companions are either dead, fled, or turned against you. You're alone in the dark.
