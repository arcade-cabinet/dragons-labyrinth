# Dragon's Labyrinth - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Traditional RPGs have become predictable power fantasies where players always become stronger and threats always become manageable. Horror games often rely on jump scares and gore rather than psychological dread. There's a gap in the market for games that use RPG mechanics to deliver genuine emotional horror experiences.

### The Solution
Dragon's Labyrinth inverts the RPG power curve. Instead of growing stronger, the world grows darker. Instead of gaining confidence, players experience mounting dread. The familiar RPG structure becomes a vehicle for horror, using player investment in companions and world to deliver emotional impact when everything falls apart.

### The Innovation
- **Narrative Orchestration**: The emotional journey IS the game orchestrator
- **Inverted Power Curve**: Growing weaker as horror intensifies
- **Companion Trauma**: NPCs that genuinely break under pressure
- **Proximity Horror**: Being hunted creates real tension
- **Moral Weight**: Choices matter because they affect people you care about

## Target Experience

### Opening Moments
Player opens their front door to a beautiful morning. Birds singing, sun shining, neighbors waving. A quest to deliver bread to the next village. Everything is perfect. Too perfect.

### Mid-Game Transformation
The world literally darkens. NPCs flee. Companions question continuing. The player realizes they're not the hero of this story - they're prey. The dragon isn't a boss to defeat - it's an inevitability to face.

### Climactic Horror
Sudden shift to first-person perspective in the labyrinth. The dragon actively hunts you. Audio cues reveal proximity. Sanity mechanics create false sounds. Your companions are either dead, fled, or turned against you. You're alone in the dark.

# Product Context

## What is Dragon's Labyrinth?
A horror RPG disguised as an adventure. The game begins with you opening your front door on a beautiful morning - a moment of peace you'll desperately wish to return to. Through hex-based exploration, you journey across a world that grows darker with each step, culminating in a first-person horror experience where you're hunted by an ancient intelligence.

## Why This Game Exists
- To create genuine dread through the journey itself, not jump scares
- To subvert RPG expectations - you don't become stronger, you become marked
- To explore psychological horror through game mechanics
- To demonstrate that the journey IS the game (like Frodo's walk to Mordor)

## Target Audience
- Horror fans seeking psychological dread over gore
- RPG players ready for subversive mechanics
- Players who appreciate narrative-driven experiences
- Those who find beauty in growing darkness

## Core Experience
### The Emotional Journey
**Peace → Unease → Dread → Terror**

This progression never reverses. Each phase transforms every system:
- NPCs go from helpful to fearful to hostile
- Quests twist from innocent to horrifying
- Your companions develop trauma and may abandon you
- The world literally darkens as you progress

### Visual Identity
- Low-poly aesthetic with vertex colors (chess-piece style)
- Hexagonal world that uses elevation for storytelling
- First-person segments that feel fundamentally wrong
- Environmental decay reflecting your curse

### The Horror Loop
1. **Door**: Open your front door (first-person) - the last peaceful moment
2. **Explore**: Hex-based world that reacts to your growing curse
3. **Survive**: Combat makes you weaker, not stronger
4. **Question**: Reality breaks down, what's real?
5. **Labyrinth**: First-person horror where the dragon hunts YOU

### Key Emotions
- **Nostalgia**: For that peaceful morning at your door
- **Unease**: Something is wrong but you can't place it
- **Dread**: The weight of inevitability
- **Terror**: Being hunted by something ancient
- **Understanding**: Multiple endings based on comprehension, not power

## Unique Selling Points
1. **The Opening**: First-person door scene that haunts players hours later
2. **Growing Dread**: Every system reinforces the horror journey
3. **Companion Trauma**: They need therapy after the labyrinth
4. **No Power Fantasy**: You become weaker, more cursed
5. **The Dragon**: Not a boss but a hunter with proximity mechanics

## What Makes It Special
- **Perspective Shifts**: Jarring transitions from hex to first-person
- **Audio-Driven Horror**: Sound is the primary fear vector
- **Sanity System**: False sounds, hallucinations, reality questions
- **Environmental Storytelling**: The world tells the story through decay
- **Narrative Coherence**: Every mechanic serves the horror arc

## Success Metrics
- Players remember the door scene days later
- Genuine emotional impact on players
- Companions feel real enough that their trauma matters
- The dragon encounter causes actual fear
- Players understand it's horror first, RPG second

## Core Philosophy
"We're not building 'an RPG with horror elements' - we're building a horror experience that happens to have RPG mechanics."

## The Dragon's Truth
The dragon is never just a boss to defeat. It's a force of nature, perhaps even protecting the world from something worse. The multiple endings depend on understanding, not defeating.

## Quote that Captures Everything
"It's a horror RPG. I really like the idea... Literally an entire book is a hobbit walking through this entire world. It doesn't even bloody end with him accomplishing anything. He's just on a mountain. It's just... You can feel it like a weight, a chill in the air."
