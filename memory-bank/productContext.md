# Product Context

## What is Dragon's Labyrinth?
A horror RPG disguised as an adventure. The game begins with you opening your front door on a beautiful morning - a moment of peace you'll desperately wish to return to. Through hex-based exploration, you journey across a world that grows darker with each step, culminating in a first-person horror experience where you're hunted by an ancient intelligence.

## Why This Game Exists
- To create genuine dread through the journey itself, not jump scares
- To subvert RPG expectations - you don't become stronger, you become marked
- To explore psychological horror through game mechanics
- To demonstrate that the journey IS the game (like Frodo's walk to Mordor)

## Target Audience
- Horror fans seeking psychological dread over gore
- RPG players ready for subversive mechanics
- Players who appreciate narrative-driven experiences
- Those who find beauty in growing darkness

## Core Experience
### The Emotional Journey
**Peace → Unease → Dread → Terror**

This progression never reverses. Each phase transforms every system:
- NPCs go from helpful to fearful to hostile
- Quests twist from innocent to horrifying
- Your companions develop trauma and may abandon you
- The world literally darkens as you progress

### Visual Identity
- Low-poly aesthetic with vertex colors (chess-piece style)
- Hexagonal world that uses elevation for storytelling
- First-person segments that feel fundamentally wrong
- Environmental decay reflecting your curse

### The Horror Loop
1. **Door**: Open your front door (first-person) - the last peaceful moment
2. **Explore**: Hex-based world that reacts to your growing curse
3. **Survive**: Combat makes you weaker, not stronger
4. **Question**: Reality breaks down, what's real?
5. **Labyrinth**: First-person horror where the dragon hunts YOU

### Key Emotions
- **Nostalgia**: For that peaceful morning at your door
- **Unease**: Something is wrong but you can't place it
- **Dread**: The weight of inevitability
- **Terror**: Being hunted by something ancient
- **Understanding**: Multiple endings based on comprehension, not power

## Unique Selling Points
1. **The Opening**: First-person door scene that haunts players hours later
2. **Growing Dread**: Every system reinforces the horror journey
3. **Companion Trauma**: They need therapy after the labyrinth
4. **No Power Fantasy**: You become weaker, more cursed
5. **The Dragon**: Not a boss but a hunter with proximity mechanics

## What Makes It Special
- **Perspective Shifts**: Jarring transitions from hex to first-person
- **Audio-Driven Horror**: Sound is the primary fear vector
- **Sanity System**: False sounds, hallucinations, reality questions
- **Environmental Storytelling**: The world tells the story through decay
- **Narrative Coherence**: Every mechanic serves the horror arc

## Success Metrics
- Players remember the door scene days later
- Genuine emotional impact on players
- Companions feel real enough that their trauma matters
- The dragon encounter causes actual fear
- Players understand it's horror first, RPG second

## Core Philosophy
"We're not building 'an RPG with horror elements' - we're building a horror experience that happens to have RPG mechanics."

## The Dragon's Truth
The dragon is never just a boss to defeat. It's a force of nature, perhaps even protecting the world from something worse. The multiple endings depend on understanding, not defeating.

## Quote that Captures Everything
"It's a horror RPG. I really like the idea... Literally an entire book is a hobbit walking through this entire world. It doesn't even bloody end with him accomplishing anything. He's just on a mountain. It's just... You can feel it like a weight, a chill in the air."
