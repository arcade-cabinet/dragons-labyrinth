# ML Extraction Refocus - Use Organized HBF Dumps as Training Data

## PARADIGM SHIFT: From Generic ML → Category-Focused Extraction

**OLD APPROACH**: Generic ML trying to figure out "what is this entity?"
**NEW APPROACH**: Focused ML with perfect training data for 4 categories

## PERFECT TRAINING DATA NOW AVAILABLE

### What We Extracted Successfully:
- **27 Regions**: Each with 7,000+ entities (detailed content)  
- **10 Settlements**: From villages (150 entities) to cities (1,000+ entities)
- **5 Factions**: Each with 200-300 entities (political depth)
- **18 Dungeons**: Each with 300-2,700 entities (massive dungeon content)

### ML Training Strategy
Instead of guessing patterns, use these organized dumps to train ML that knows EXACTLY:
- What JSON structure represents hex tiles vs NPCs vs encounters
- How weather tables are formatted vs treasure tables
- Settlement complexity patterns (village vs town vs city)
- Faction relationship structures
- Dungeon area organization
