# Active Development Context

This directory contains the current working context for Dragon's Labyrinth development.

## Files

### Core Context
- `activeContext.md` - Current development focus and immediate tasks
- `current_task_plan.md` - Detailed task breakdown
- `progress.md` - Overall project progress tracking

### Development Prompts
- `cursor-prompt.md` - Guidelines for Cursor AI assistance
- `cursor-handoff.md` - Context for development handoffs
- `background-agent-kickoff.md` - Background generation agent setup
- `background-yolo-prompt.md` - Overnight generation instructions

### Technical Context  
- `productContext.md` - Product vision and requirements
- `techContext.md` - Technical architecture decisions
- `systemPatterns.md` - Code patterns and conventions
- `implementation_checklist.md` - Feature implementation tracking

### Session Management
- `handoff-checklist.md` - Checklist for session handoffs
- `nightly-handoff.md` - Overnight task preparation
- `overnight-agent-status.md` - Background generation status
- `session-summary.md` - Recent session summaries

## Purpose

These files are the "working memory" of the project - they track:
- What we're currently building
- How we're building it
- What needs to be done next
- Context for AI assistants

As features are completed and designs are finalized, content moves from here to the formal documentation in `crates/dragons-docs`.

## Usage

When starting a development session:
1. Review `activeContext.md` for current focus
2. Check `current_task_plan.md` for specific tasks
3. Consult `cursor-prompt.md` for development guidelines

When ending a session:
1. Update `progress.md` with completed work
2. Update `activeContext.md` with next steps
3. Use `handoff-checklist.md` to ensure continuity
