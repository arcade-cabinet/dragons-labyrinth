# Playthrough Critique - Finding the Flaws

## PLAYER: Sarah, First-Time Player
**Expectations**: Heard it's a dark RPG with choices that matter
**Playstyle**: Typically plays supportive roles, likes story

---

## LEVEL 1: The Door

**My Experience**:
Opening is strong. The door choice feels heavy. I choose "Come with me" because I don't want to be alone in a horror game.

**PROBLEM #1**: What's my friend's name? The game calls them "friend" but that feels impersonal. Need immediate name/personality.

**PROBLEM #2**: Why do I care about silent birds? I just started. Need more emotional connection to the village first - maybe show normal life THEN birds stop?

---

## LEVELS 1-3: Path to First Village

**My Experience**:
Fighting wolves is fine, but...

**PROBLEM #3**: Combat feels samey. 2-3 lone wolves, then 4-5 wolves. Where's variety? Maybe wolf + something else? Weather affecting combat?

**PROBLEM #4**: My companion just says generic things like "Watch out!" Where's personality? They should have combat preferences that hint at their character.

**PROBLEM #5**: The hill choice is good BUT I don't know elevation matters yet. First time players might always take easy path. Need clearer advantage visible from below.

I reach Level 3 and arrive at village...

## LEVELS 3-5: First Village

**My Experience**:
Finally, civilization! But wait...

**PROBLEM #6**: Village has "~20 NPCs, 5 shops, 3 quest givers" - that's overwhelming! I talk to everyone and get quest overload. Need better introduction - maybe some shops closed initially?

**PROBLEM #7**: The Missing Child quest - why should I care? I don't know this child. Need emotional hook - maybe child was playing with MY childhood toy?

**PROBLEM #8**: Weapon at 70% durability already? From just 5 wolf fights? Feels punishing early. Maybe 85%?

## LEVELS 5-10: Building to Mini-Boss

**My Experience**:
Exploring hexes around village...

**PROBLEM #9**: Each hex has encounters/resources but no connecting thread. Feels like random MMO grinding. Need narrative connecting these areas - tracking something?

**PROBLEM #10**: Weather affects movement but I haven't learned mount system yet. So I'm just... slower? Frustrated? Need positive weather effects too (wind at back?).

**PROBLEM #11**: "Rally Militia" quest - why would farmers listen to a Level 8 nobody? Need reputation threshold or alternative approach.

---

## LEVEL 10: First Mini-Boss

**My Experience**:
Bandit Lieutenant attacks...

**PROBLEM #12**: He's mounted but I'm not (mounts at L13). Feels unfair, not challenging. Maybe he dismounts for honor? Or I can spook horse?

**PROBLEM #13**: "Tests basic DPS" - but what if I built defensive/support because I have companion? Need multiple victory conditions.

**PROBLEM #14**: Defeat = lose gold and wake up. So death has no weight? Need scars, trauma, or permanent change from first death.

---

## LEVEL 13: Mount Introduction

**My Experience**:
Merchant's horse breaks leg...

**PROBLEM #15**: This feels random/convenient. Need foreshadowing - maybe merchant passed us earlier? We saw him struggling?

**PROBLEM #16**: If I ignore, "no mount yet" - but when? This could softlock players who don't realize importance. Need alternative mount option by L15.

---

## LEVELS 15-20: Second Village & Cave

**My Experience**:
Military outpost, preparing for bandits...

**PROBLEM #17**: Why didn't military handle bandits already? Makes them look incompetent. Need reason - stretched thin? Corruption in ranks?

**PROBLEM #18**: "Children inside cave" - this is HUGE but mentioned casually. Need more weight - maybe we hear them crying? See toys outside?

---

## LEVEL 20: Bandit Cave

**My Experience**:
The 2.5D → 3D transition is cool but...

**PROBLEM #19**: Why does cave have this technology shift? Feels gamey. Need narrative reason - ancient construction? Dragon influence?

**PROBLEM #20**: Boss fight with "children watching" - this is HEAVY for Level 20. Some players will quit. Need option to send children away first?

**PROBLEM #21**: The four choices (Mercy/Justice/Execution/Cruelty) - what determines which I can pick? Stats? Philosophy? Need clearer gating.

## SYSTEMIC ISSUES DISCOVERED

### Companion Problems:
- **Personality too generic** - needs unique dialogue
- **No growth visible** - should level with me
- **No relationship mechanics** - where's bonding?
- **No disagreement** - always supports me?

### Pacing Problems:
- **Quests pile up** - overwhelming at villages
- **Reputation invisible** - when does it matter?
- **Philosophy unclear** - am I building toward something?
- **Resource management harsh** - weapon degrades too fast

### Motivation Problems:
- **Why do I care?** - about birds, children, villagers
- **What's my goal?** - beyond "investigate birds"
- **Who am I?** - no backstory or motivation
- **Where's urgency?** - can I just stay in village?

### Combat Problems:
- **Too samey** - wolves, wolves, more wolves
- **No variety** - where are different attack patterns?
- **Companion passive** - just makes fights easier
- **No tactical depth** - just hit things

### Mount System Problems:
- **Introduced late** - mini-boss is mounted at L10
- **Missable** - can skip and softlock
- **No buildup** - sudden introduction
- **No alternatives** - one chance only?

---

## FIXES NEEDED

### Immediate (Must Fix):
1. **Companion needs name/personality immediately**
2. **Combat variety from Level 1**
3. **Village quest overload prevention**
4. **Mount foreshadowing and alternatives**
5. **Death needs weight from first occurrence**

### Important (Should Fix):
1. **Weather needs positive effects too**
2. **Reputation visibility system**
3. **Philosophy path hints early**
4. **Multiple victory conditions for bosses**
5. **Clearer advantage communication**

### Polish (Would Be Nice):
1. **Emotional hooks for every quest**
2. **Narrative connections between areas**
3. **Companion growth visibility**
4. **Resource management tutorials**
5. **Urgency without pressure**

---

## WHAT'S WORKING

### Strong Points:
- Door choice feels weighty
- Moral choices have impact
- World reacts to decisions
- No obvious tutorials
- Organic discovery potential

### Good Concepts:
- Mount system (just needs better introduction)
- Reputation (needs visibility)
- Philosophy paths (need clarity)
- No filler principle (mostly working)
- 3D dungeon transitions (need narrative reason)

## THE VERDICT

**Would I Keep Playing?**
Honestly? I'm not sure. The opening is strong but by Level 10 I'm feeling:
- Overwhelmed (too many quests)
- Confused (what's my build?)
- Frustrated (unfair mini-boss)
- Disconnected (why do I care?)

**The Core Issue**:
The game knows where it's going but doesn't help ME know. I need more guidance without tutorials, more connection without exposition, more variety without filler.

**The Big Question**:
By Level 20, am I excited for Level 21? Or am I exhausted by choice paralysis and tonal whiplash?

This needs refinement to match the brilliant vision with the actual player experience.
