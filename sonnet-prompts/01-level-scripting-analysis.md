# Level Scripting Analysis for Dragon's Labyrinth

## Your Task
You have access to 1.7GB of organized CC0 assets in `crates/game-content-static/assets/`. Your job is to analyze the Yoleck level editor integration and help script the COMPLETE level progression for Dragon's Labyrinth.

## Critical Context
This is an EMOTIONAL HORROR JOURNEY, not a procedural RPG. Every level must serve the narrative progression:
- Peace → Unease → Dread → Terror → Horror

## Level Requirements

### Act 1: Journey TO Labyrinth (6 transitions)
1. **The Abandoned Cart** - First moral choice
2. **The Burning Village** - Save or flee  
3. **The Starving Refugees** - Share or hoard
4. **The Bridge Troll** - Fight or negotiate
5. **The Wounded Soldier** - Help enemy or leave
6. **The Fork in the Road** - Choose companion's fate

### Act 2: Fighting the Dragon (4 transitions)
1. **The Dragon's Offer** - Power for service
2. **The Companion's Plea** - Sacrifice request
3. **The Innocent Hostage** - Save at cost
4. **The Final Betrayal** - Trust broken

### Act 3: Sealing the Void (2 transitions)
1. **The Price of Victory** - What you've become
2. **The World's Judgment** - How others see you

## Philosophy Path Variations
Each level must have FOUR completely different experiences based on:
- **Strength Path**: Combat, command, conquest
- **Harmony Path**: Empathy, trust, sacrifice
- **Light Path**: Faith, protection, miracles
- **Dark Path**: Corruption, consumption, power

## Companion Variations
Each level must account for:
- Solo player
- With Einar (loyal but breaks)
- With Mira (abandons in Dread)
- With Sorin (potential traitor)
- With Tamara (innocent)
- With mercenaries (no loyalty)
- Mixed party combinations

## Your Deliverables
1. Complete Yoleck entity definitions for EVERY scenario
2. Scripted triggers for all philosophy branches
3. Companion-specific dialogue and reactions
4. Dread-responsive environmental changes
5. Precise emotional beats and timing

## Assets Available
Review the assets in each category and identify:
- Which models work for each scene
- What's missing that needs generation
- How to repurpose medieval assets for horror

Remember: This is the FOUNDATION. Get the emotional journey perfect FIRST.
