## THE ULTIMATE TEST

If a player can say "This is just filler" or "This is just a tutorial" - WE'VE FAILED.

Every moment should either:
- Serve immediate purpose
- Plant future seeds
- Reward past investment
- Reveal hidden truth
- Create memorable moment
- Build emotional weight

## THE PROMISE TO PLAYERS

"Everything matters. Nothing is arbitrary. Your patience will be rewarded. Your attention will pay off. That seemingly pointless thing? It's the key to everything. Trust the journey."

This is how we create a game where players finish and immediately say: "I need to play again. Everything makes sense now."
