# The Opening Sequence - First 6 Levels in Detail

## THE MOST IMPORTANT HOURS
The first 6 levels (roughly 2 hours of gameplay) determine whether players continue or quit. Every moment must be crafted for maximum engagement while teaching through discovery.

## LEVEL 1: THE DOOR

### Scene Setup
**Location**: Your childhood home
**Time**: Dawn, golden hour lighting
**Mood**: Peaceful but with subtle wrongness

### The Moment
```
You wake to silence. 
The birds have stopped singing.
Your friend waits outside.
The door handle gleams in morning light.
```

### Opening Interaction
**Camera**: First-person, can look around room
**Interactables**: 
- Family portrait (establish backstory)
- Window (see friend waiting)
- Chest (contains starter equipment)
- Door (the choice)

### THE PIVOTAL CHOICE

**Friend's Dialogue** (through door):
"Are you ready? The village elder says someone needs to investigate why the birds went quiet."
"I know you've dreamed of adventure since we were children."
"I... I could come with you. If you want."
"Or I could stay here, tell your family where you've gone."
"What do you say?"

**Options**:
1. **"Come with me. I need a friend."** → Companion start (Harmony seed)
2. **"Stay safe. This is my path."** → Solo start (Strength seed)
3. **"Your choice. I won't decide for you."** → Friend decides based on hidden personality

### Immediate Consequences

**WITH COMPANION**:
- Friend: "Thank you. I've packed supplies for both of us."
- Receive: 2x healing potions, 2x rations, shared tent
- Combat tutorial feels natural (friend suggests tactics)
- Emotional support during first combat

**SOLO**:
- Friend: "I understand. You were always the brave one."
- Receive: 1x healing potion, 1x ration, solo tent, +10% XP bonus
- Combat is harder but more rewarding
- Inner monologue instead of dialogue

## LEVEL 2-3: THE PATH TO FIRST VILLAGE

### Environmental Teaching

**The Hill Moment** (Organic discovery of elevation):
- Path splits: Low road (easy) vs High road (harder climb)
- **Low road**: 3 weak enemies in ambush
- **High road**: 1 weak enemy but you have advantage
- **LESSON**: Height matters (discovered, not told)

### First Combat Variations

**WITH COMPANION**:
- **Enemy**: 2 wolves
- Companion shouts: "I'll distract one!"
- Learn flanking naturally
- Share victory ("We did it!")

**SOLO**:
- **Enemy**: 1 wolf
- Must use environment (rocks, trees)
- Learn positioning importance
- Victory is personal ("I can do this")

### The Weather Shift
**Hour 1**: Sunny (no effects)
**Hour 2**: Clouds gather (visibility reduces)
**Hour 3**: Light rain (movement slows)
**LESSON**: Weather matters, time of day matters

## LEVEL 4: FIRST VILLAGE - THE BRANCHING

### Village State Based on Approach

**IF SOLO**:
```
The village seems quiet, wary.
Guards grip weapons tighter as you approach.
"Another sellsword looking for work?"
```

**IF WITH COMPANION**:
```
The village seems welcoming.
Guards relax seeing two young travelers.
"Ah, safety in numbers. Wise choice these days."
```

### The Mercenary Encounter (SOLO PATH ONLY)

**Location**: Village tavern
**Character**: Gruff veteran mercenary

**Mercenary's Pitch**:
"Saw you come in alone. Brave or foolish, can't tell yet."
"Names's Marcus. Been killing for coin twenty years."
"There's a bandit cave the elder wants cleared."
"50 gold for my sword. 70 if you want me to take point."
"Or go alone and probably die. Your choice, hero."

**CHOICES**:
1. **Hire at 50** → Mercenary path begins
2. **Negotiate to 40** → (Requires charisma) Mercenary respects cunning
3. **Refuse proudly** → True solo, +Reputation "Lone Wolf"
4. **Refuse rudely** → Solo, -Reputation with mercenaries

### The Companion Moment (COMPANION PATH)

**Companion's Connection**:
"My cousin lives here! Haven't seen her in years."
"She might have information about the bandits."
"Should we visit her first, or talk to the elder?"

**CHOICES**:
1. **Visit cousin** → Personal quest, deeper companion bond
2. **See elder first** → Professional focus, companion disappointed
3. **Split up briefly** → Test separation mechanics

### Village Services Introduction

**Blacksmith** (Weapon maintenance discovered):
- Your sword is at 80% durability from road combat
- "I can fix that, or teach you how..."

**General Store** (Resource management):
- Rations, potions, torches
- Prices affected by reputation already

**Inn** (Rest and rumors):

### Level 6 Climax - The First Dream

**That night, regardless of path**:
```
You dream of a door.
Not your door. An ancient door.
Behind it, something whispers:
"You've taken your first steps.
The dragon stirs.
The void watches.
Your choices echo in places you cannot yet imagine."
```

**Wake to find**: Birds still silent. Journey must continue.

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR OPENING

### Every Choice Must:
1. Have immediate visible consequence
2. Plant seeds for later payoff
3. Feel natural, not forced
4. Teach without telling
5. Create emotional investment

### The Opening Successfully:
- Establishes tone (choice matters)
- Teaches core mechanics (organically)
- Creates attachment (companion/solo identity)
- Hooks player (mystery of silent birds)
- Sets up entire game (mercy vs efficiency)

### Pacing Targets:
- **Level 1**: 15 minutes (weight of choice)
- **Level 2-3**: 20 minutes (learn combat/movement)
- **Level 4**: 25 minutes (explore village, make connections)
- **Level 5-6**: 30 minutes (first real challenge)
- **Total**: ~90 minutes to hook completely

## THE GENIUS OF THIS OPENING

### It Teaches Everything Without Teaching:
- Combat through necessity
- Elevation through discovery
- Weather through experience
- Reputation through reaction
- Morality through choice
- Resources through scarcity

### It Establishes Everything:
- You're not special (just a villager)
- Choices define you (not class)
- World reacts to you (reputation)
- Companion vs solo (fundamental split)
- Mercy vs efficiency (philosophy seeds)
- Something is wrong (birds silent)

### It Hooks Completely:
- Personal (your village, your friend)
- Mysterious (why are birds silent?)
- Empowering (your choices matter)
- Challenging (bandits are real threat)
- Promising (dragon dream hints at epic scope)

This opening 90 minutes determines everything. Get this right, and players will pursue all 180 levels.
