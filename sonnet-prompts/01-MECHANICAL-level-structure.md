## KEY MECHANICAL VARIETY

### Overworld (Hex-Based)

- Weather systems
- Day/night cycles
- Resource management
- Army positioning
- Territory control
- Environmental puzzles
- Faction diplomacy

### Dungeon Crawling (2.5D → 3D)
- Side-scrolling sections (early game)
- DOOM-style corridors (mid game)
- Multi-level complexes (late game)
- Non-Euclidean spaces (void sections)
- First-person horror (labyrinth/dragon)
- Vertical progression
- Sound-based navigation
- Light/darkness mechanics

### Boss Encounters (Unique Arenas)
- NOT overworld fights
- Arena geometry matters

- Environmental hazards
- Pattern recognition
- Philosophy-specific strategies
- Companion coordination
- Resource attrition

### Using CC0 3D Models
**Medieval Models** (for early dungeons):
- Castle corridors
- Dungeon cells
- Throne rooms
- Towers and battlements

**Horror Models** (for corruption):
- Twisted architecture
- Organic growths
- Impossible geometry
- Flesh and bone structures

**Transition Effects**:
- Clean models → corrupted variants
- Texture swapping for dread levels
- Geometry distortion at high madness
- Lighting changes for atmosphere

## ORGANIC MECHANIC INTRODUCTION

### Never Force, Always Entice
- Height advantage discovered through exploration
- Weapon switching learned through enemy variety
- Companion positioning emerges from tactical needs
- Resource management comes from scarcity
- Stealth attempted when overwhelmed
- Magic discovered through desperation

### Progressive Complexity
1. **Simple Discovery**: "Oh, I can climb this hill"
2. **Tactical Application**: "Height gives combat advantage"
3. **Strategic Planning**: "I need to control hilltops"
4. **System Mastery**: "Elevation + weather + time = victory"
5. **Subversion**: "Void makes elevation meaningless"
6. **Recontextualization**: "I must create my own high ground"

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Player Engagement
- Never more than 3 levels without mechanical variety
- Each phase introduces OR subverts mechanics
- Boss fights feel categorically different
- Overworld → Dungeon transitions are exciting
- 3D sections are memorable set pieces
- Horror emerges from mechanical subversion

### Mechanical Depth
- 180 levels, none feel repetitive
- Each system has 5+ layers of mastery
- Philosophy paths use different mechanics
- Companion combinations enable new strategies
- Trait accumulation changes gameplay
- Final sections test everything

This is a COMPLETE mechanical journey where every level matters, every system builds on the last, and the 2.5D → 3D transitions keep players constantly engaged. The CC0 3D models aren't just assets - they're the building blocks of increasingly complex and horrifying labyrinths that ARE the game's identity.
