## HOW TO HIDE TUTORIALS

### Combat Training = Desperate Survival
**NOT**: "Attack the training dummy 3 times"
**INSTEAD**: Wolves attack, friend shouts suggestions:
- "Watch their pattern!" (player learns timing)
- "Use the tree!" (player learns environment)
- "They're protecting something!" (player learns observation)

### Inventory Management = Scarcity Pressure
**NOT**: "Open inventory and equip sword"
**INSTEAD**: Sword in mud, wolves approaching:
- Scramble to grab weapon (opens inventory naturally)
- No time to organize (learn quick-equip)
- Drop heavy items to run (weight matters)

### Dialogue Choices = Actual Conversation
**NOT**: "Choose dialogue option to continue"
**INSTEAD**: Friend asks real question:
- Silence is an option (changes relationship)
- Interrupting possible (shows impatience)
