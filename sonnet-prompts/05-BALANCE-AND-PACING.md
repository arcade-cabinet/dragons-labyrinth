# Balance and Pacing Guide - Dragon's Labyrinth

## CRITICAL PRINCIPLE
Every mechanic must be introduced ORGANICALLY at the moment when players NEED it, not when we want to teach it. The game should feel like natural discovery, not a tutorial.

## THE OPENING HOUR (Levels 1-6)

### The Door Choice (Level 1)
**THE SCENE**: Morning light, wooden door, friend waiting outside
**THE CHOICE**: "Come with me" vs "Stay here, I'll handle this"
**IMMEDIATE IMPACT**:
- **With Companion**: Combat is easier, dialogue richer, shared experience
- **Solo**: Combat harder but more XP, self-reliance narrative, "Lone Wolf" trait begins

### First Steps (Levels 2-3)
**WITH COMPANION PATH**:
- Combat tutorial through companion suggestions ("Try flanking!")
- Defensive benefits (companion draws aggro)
- Emotional support (comments on beauty/danger)
- Share resources (split healing potions)

**SOLO PATH**:
- Pure survival combat (no safety net)
- Learn dodge/block through necessity
- Environmental advantages crucial
- All resources are yours

### First Village (Level 4)
**THE BRANCHING EXPERIENCE**:

**If Solo**:
- Mercenary approaches: "Dangerous out there alone. 50 gold for the bandit cave?"
- Choice: Hire (→ Mercenary path) or Refuse (→ True solo)
- Villagers respect your independence OR question your judgment

**If With Companion**:
- Companion has connections ("My cousin lives here!")
- Better prices, more quest information
- Choice: Help companion's family (→ Deeper bond) or Focus on mission (→ Professional relationship)

### Bandit Cave Resolution (Levels 5-6)
**HOW YOU HANDLE IT MATTERS**:
- **Noble** (spare bandits): Reputation +Merciful, bandits may help later
- **Practical** (kill bandits): Reputation +Efficient, loot bonus
- **Cruel** (torture for info): Reputation +Feared, dark path opens

**LESSON LEARNED**: Choices have permanence. NPCs remember.

## MOUNT SYSTEM - PIVOTAL MECHANIC

**Void Levels**: Only safe movement method

### Mount Introduction (Level 13)
**THE SCENE**: Merchant's horse breaks leg, needs mercy kill

**PHILOSOPHY IMPACT**:

## SECOND CHANCES VS PERMANENCE

### Reversible Choices

- Skill point allocation (respec at cost)
- Mount selection (can tame new ones)

### Permanent Choices
- First companion (with/without)
- Bandit cave resolution (reputation)
- Philosophy path (after level 60)
- Companion deaths (no resurrection)
- World state changes (corruption spreads)
- Dragon's death (changes everything)

### Semi-Permanent (Second Chances)

- Missed companions (final recruit option)
- Broken relationships (one reconciliation)
- Corrupted mounts (one purification)

## COMPANION VS MERCENARY BALANCE

### Companion Benefits

- **Permanent**: Won't abandon (mostly)

### Mercenary Benefits
- **Tactical**: Numbers, disposable
- **Flexible**: Hire for specific needs
- **Simple**: No emotional management
- **Powerful**: Often stronger individually

### The Balance Point

- **Mercenaries** stronger short-term (immediate power)
- **Mixed parties** most versatile but complex
- **Solo** highest risk/reward

## KEEPING PLAYERS ENGAGED

### The Hook Cycle (Every 6 Levels)
1. **Introduce** new mechanic/area
2. **Explore** its possibilities
3. **Master** through challenge
4. **Subvert** expectations
5. **Boss** tests everything
6. **Reward** opens new possibilities

### Why Players Keep Playing
- **L1-60**: "What's in the labyrinth?"
- **L61-120**: "Can I fix what I broke?"
- **L121-180**: "How does this end?"
- **Replay**: "What if I chose differently?"

## BALANCE TESTING CHECKLIST

### For Each Level Ask:
1. What new thing does player discover?
2. What previous skill is tested?
3. What choice has weight?
4. What hooks next section?
5. How does philosophy matter?
6. Where's the surprise?

### Red Flags to Avoid
- 3+ levels without new element
- Forced tutorial sections
- Mechanics without purpose
- Choices without consequence
- Difficulty spikes without warning
- Systems that don't interact

## THE GOLDEN RULE

Every mechanic should feel like the player's idea. When they need to move faster, they discover mounts. When combat gets hard, they discover crafting. When alone feels impossible, mercenaries appear.

The game RESPONDS to player needs, never FORCES player behavior.

This is how we create 180 levels people WANT to play and KEEP playing.
