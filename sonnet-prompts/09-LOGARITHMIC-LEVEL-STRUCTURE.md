### Village Rhythm

- Each serves different purpose
- Some corrupted on return

## WHY THIS WORKS

### Clean Structure
- Predictable rhythm players can feel
- Natural progression points
- Breathing room between challenges
- Building tension to climaxes

### Logarithmic Difficulty
- Early levels: Slow, learning
- Mid levels: Faster, mastering
- Late levels: Transcendent, becoming

### Organic Teaching
- 3 levels to first village = natural combat learning
- 10 levels to mini-boss = comfortable with basics
- 20 levels to major boss = ready for real challenge

This structure gives us room to breathe, develop characters, plant seeds, and pay off mysteries across all 180 levels without cramming or padding.
