# The World of Aethermoor - Foundation Document

## World Name: Aethermoor
*"The Moorlands of the First Light"*

A world caught between the dying echoes of an ancient peace and the growing whispers of primordial darkness. Once, the great dragon Pyraxis held dominion not as tyrant, but as guardian—his flames a seal against the hungering void that lies beneath all reality.

## Core Geographic Philosophy
Aethermoor is structured as concentric rings of corruption spreading outward from the Dragon's Labyrinth at its heart. The farther from civilization's cradle, the more reality itself begins to fray.

### The Great Rings of Aethermoor

**The Heartlands (Bands 1-20)**: Rolling pastures, ancient forests, and gentle mountain valleys where life still flourishes. Here, children play in meadows dotted with wildflowers, and the worst monsters are mere wolves and bandits. Yet even here, careful observers notice withered patches in otherwise healthy fields, and the old-timers speak of dreams that taste of ash.

**The Contested Lands (Bands 21-40)**: Where civilization meets the first scars of dragon-flight. Charred forests stand adjacent to living groves. Villages show signs of recent raids, and the local lords speak in hushed tones of "the troubles to the east." Trade routes detour around blackened valleys.

**The Burning Marches (Bands 41-60)**: The approach to the Labyrinth proper. Here, the dragon's influence turns the land to lava fields and obsidian deserts. Ancient fortresses stand as monuments to humanity's last desperate attempts to contain what they thought was evil. Reality grows thin, and void-whispers can be heard by those who listen too closely.

**The Broken Realm (Bands 61-120)**: The return journey reveals the true horror—not environmental devastation, but social collapse. With the dragon dead, old alliances shatter. Warlords seize power, refugees flee toward ever-shrinking safe zones, and the first void-cracks begin appearing in populated areas.

**The Nightmare Expanse (Bands 121-180)**: Where the void breaks free entirely. Familiar landscapes twist into impossible geometries. The sky bleeds colors that have no names. Survivors huddle around failing ward-stones while reality itself comes apart at the seams.

## The Dragon's Truth
Pyraxis was not evil—he was the last guardian, using his eternal flame to seal void-cracks and maintain reality's integrity. His labyrinth was both prison and fortress, containing horrors too vast for mortal comprehension. By slaying him, the hero becomes complicit in reality's unraveling.

## Day/Night Cycle Philosophy
- **Day**: 8 hex-tile movement maximum for walking (12 for running with encounter risk)
- **Night**: Requires shelter/fire in most biomes after Band 20
- **Weather**: Amplifies rest requirements (cold snaps, void-storms)
- **Seasonal**: Affects biome generation and encounter tables

## Rest & Shelter Mechanics
- **Civilized areas**: Inns, houses, town squares with guard patrols
- **Wilderness**: Must build fire, set camp, post watches
- **Hostile biomes**: Shelter becomes life-or-death survival
- **Companion system**: Some companions excel at wilderness survival, others at social navigation

## Regional Design Principles
Each region defines:
1. **Emotional Arc**: What the player should feel/learn
2. **Biome Composition**: Hex types and their ratios
3. **Travel Scope**: Typical crossing time in days
4. **Adjacency Rules**: Which regions connect (geographically and thematically)
5. **Core Quests**: 3-5 major story beats
6. **Side Encounters**: Random events that reinforce theme
7. **Key NPCs**: Named characters with specific roles
8. **Transition Hooks**: 3D scenes that advance the main narrative
9. **Asset Requirements**: Visual/audio elements that must exist

This foundation ensures every region serves both mechanical gameplay and narrative progression, with the AI orchestrator able to generate consistent, thematically appropriate content.
