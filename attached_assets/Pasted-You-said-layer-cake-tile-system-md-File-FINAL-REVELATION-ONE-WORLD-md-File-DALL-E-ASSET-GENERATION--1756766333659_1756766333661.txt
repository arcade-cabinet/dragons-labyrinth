So if you use vision analysis on those images and review the game design docs for the game I'm building you'll understand my pickle. Desert is an example of when the prompt works beautifully.  I mean that is just a gorgeous biome texture. Plins is unusable because it's a circle. Void is whatever void is. And mountain is a damned 45 degree tilt with a oath through it! I also sent you the master asset prompt list. How  can I refine my biome prompts specifically into ones of better consistency for my goals

Got it — I see your issue clearly now. The Layer Cake Tile System
 and One World progression architecture
 rely on clean, composable biome tiles, but your asset prompt set
 sometimes produces inconsistent geometry:

Desert worked perfectly: a flat, aerial terrain texture.

Plains came out circular instead of edge-to-edge terrain.

Mountain generated at an isometric tilt instead of top-down.

Void is too abstract / inconsistent.

This is happening because your current prompts don’t explicitly constrain perspective, framing, and tiling properties. DALL·E is adding its own “best guess,” which introduces circles, tilt, or abstract geometry.

Why This Happens

Perspective Drift – If “top-down” isn’t reinforced enough, the model slips into isometric or landscape renderings.

Framing Bias – Words like “circle,” “portal,” or even just “ocean/void” push the model toward round compositions.

Tileability Gaps – The AI defaults to “contained illustrations” unless you force “edge-to-edge seamless terrain.”

Abstract Concepts – “Void” or “nightmare” encourage surreal geometry instead of flat tile layers.

Prompt Refinement Strategy
1. Lock in Camera & Composition

For every biome, force repetition-safe aerial framing:

Use “seamless edge-to-edge terrain texture”

Reinforce “flat aerial top-down perspective”

Add “square 1024x1024 tileable texture, no borders, no circles”

Example:

"Golden sandy desert terrain, seamless edge-to-edge texture, flat aerial top-down view, medieval dark fantasy game asset, 1024x1024 tileable, no circular framing, no tilt"

2. Separate Biome Concept from Atmosphere

Base Biome Prompt = “texture” (flat terrain).

Mood Layers (corruption, nightmare, void) should reuse the same structure but with added texture adjectives.

Example (Void biome reined in):

"Warped cracked dark ground, seamless edge-to-edge terrain texture, flat aerial top-down view, medieval eldritch fantasy game asset, 1024x1024 tileable, avoid circular shapes or symbols"

3. Add Negative Prompting (by phrasing constraints)

While DALL·E doesn’t have explicit negative prompt syntax like MJ, you can phrase rules:

“no tilt, no perspective, no horizon”

“do not depict symbols, circles, borders, frames”

4. Consistency Tags

End every biome prompt with a style lock:

"medieval dark fantasy, game-ready top-down tile, seamless texture"
This keeps your desert, plains, mountain, and void aligned.

Suggested Biome Prompt Rewrites

Plains (fix circle issue)

"Lush green grassland with wildflowers, seamless edge-to-edge terrain texture, flat aerial top-down perspective, medieval fantasy tile, 1024x1024, no circular shapes, no framing"

Mountain (fix tilt)

"Gray rocky mountain terrain with scattered stone ridges, seamless edge-to-edge aerial texture, flat top-down view, medieval fantasy tile, 1024x1024, no tilt, no perspective angles"

Void (fix abstraction)

"Cracked black ground with faint glowing fissures, seamless edge-to-edge terrain texture, flat aerial top-down view, medieval eldritch fantasy tile, 1024x1024, no circles, no portals"

Desert (already working — just reinforce)

"Golden sandy desert terrain with subtle dunes, seamless edge-to-edge aerial texture, flat top-down perspective, medieval fantasy tile, 1024x1024, no circular framing
