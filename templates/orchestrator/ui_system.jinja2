# Generate UI System with Hexagonal Navigation

## Context
Create a comprehensive UI system for Dragon's Labyrinth that embraces the hexagonal nature of the game. The UI should be both functional and thematically consistent with the hex-based gameplay.

## Core UI Components

### 1. Hexagonal Navigation Wheel (Bottom Right)
Generate a unique navigation interface:
- **Central Compass**: Shows player's current facing direction
  - Rotates smoothly as player moves/turns
  - Displays cardinal directions (N, NE, SE, S, SW, NW)
  - Glows subtly to indicate active direction
  
- **Six Movement Segments**: Surrounding the compass
  - Each segment represents one hex movement direction
  - Visual states: Normal, Hover, Pressed, Disabled
  - Touch/click areas sized for easy mobile interaction
  - Keyboard shortcuts displayed on hover (Q,W,E,A,S,D or numpad)
  - Arrow indicators pointing to each hex direction
  - Highlights valid movement options based on terrain

- **Visual Design**:
  - Semi-transparent background with hex pattern
  - Subtle glow effects matching game's art style
  - Size: ~200x200 pixels, scalable for different screens
  - Smooth animations for all interactions

### 2. Main HUD Elements
- **Health/Mana Bars**: Curved to follow screen edge
- **Skill Hotbar**: Hexagonal skill slots (6 active skills)
- **Mini-map**: Hex-based fog of war display
- **Turn Indicator**: For turn-based mode
- **Resource Counters**: Gold, experience, items

### 3. Inventory System
- Grid-based with hexagonal item slots
- Equipment paper doll with hex-shaped slots
- Item comparison tooltips
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Search/filter options

### 4. Combat UI
- Floating damage numbers
- Status effect indicators
- Turn order display (for turn-based mode)
- Action points/movement range visualization
- Target information panel

### 5. Menu Systems
- Main menu with hexagonal button design
- Settings with slider controls
- Save/Load interface with preview images
- Character selection screen showcasing discovered classes

## Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full UI with hover states
- **Mobile**: Touch-optimized with larger hit areas
- **Gamepad**: D-pad navigation with clear selection indicators

## Integration with Discovered Assets
{% for ui_element in discovered_ui_elements %}
- {{ ui_element.name }}: {{ ui_element.usage }}
{% endfor %}

## Accessibility Features
- Colorblind modes
- UI scaling options
- High contrast mode
- Screen reader support for key elements

## Animation Guidelines
