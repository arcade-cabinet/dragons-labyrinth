# Generate Character Progression and Leveling System

## Context
Create a rewarding progression system that allows players to customize their characters based on discovered class assets. The system should encourage exploration and provide meaningful choices at each level.

## Core Leveling Mechanics

### 1. Experience System
- **XP Sources**:
  - Combat victories: Base 100 XP * enemy level
  - Quest completion: 200-1000 XP based on difficulty
  - Exploration: 50 XP for discovering new areas
  - First-time enemy defeats: +50% XP bonus
  - Perfect combat (no damage): +25% XP bonus
  
- **Level Requirements (Logarithmic)**:
  ```
  XP_Required = 1000 * (1.5 ^ (Level - 1))
  
  Examples:
  Level 1→2: 1,000 XP
  Level 2→3: 1,500 XP  
  Level 3→4: 2,250 XP
  Level 10→11: ~38,000 XP
  Level 20→21: ~325,000 XP
  
  This creates a smooth curve where each level takes ~50% more XP than the previous
  Max Level: 50 (but designed to be extendable)
  ```

### 2. Stat Growth System

#### Primary Stats (Player chooses 2 per level)
- **Strength**: +3 melee damage, +5 HP
- **Dexterity**: +1 AP, +5% dodge chance
- **Intelligence**: +10 mana, +2 spell power
- **Vitality**: +15 HP, +2 HP regen/turn
- **Perception**: +1 hex sight range, +10% crit chance
- **Luck**: +5% item drop rate, +3% all resistances

#### Class-Specific Growth
{% for class in discovered_classes %}
- **{{ class.name }}**:
  - Primary stat: {{ class.primary_stat }} (+2 bonus per level)
  - Secondary stat: {{ class.secondary_stat }} (+1 bonus per level)
  - Unique growth: {{ class.special_growth }}
{% endfor %}

### 3. Skill Point System

#### Skill Trees
Each class has three skill trees:
1. **Combat Tree**: Direct damage and combat abilities
2. **Utility Tree**: Movement, buffs, and tactical options  
3. **Mastery Tree**: Class-specific unique abilities

#### Skill Points
- 1 skill point per level
- Bonus points from:
  - Boss defeats: +1 point
  - Hidden challenges: +1 point
  - Class quests: +2 points

#### Skill Progression
```
Tier 1 (Levels 1-10): Basic skills, 1 point each
Tier 2 (Levels 11-25): Advanced skills, 2 points each
Tier 3 (Levels 26-40): Master skills, 3 points each
Tier 4 (Levels 41-50): Legendary skills, 5 points each
```

### 4. Talent System

#### Passive Talents (Choose 1 every 5 levels)
- **Hex Walker**: +1 movement range
- **Efficient Caster**: -1 mana cost for all spells
- **Battle Hardened**: +10% physical resistance
- **Quick Reflexes**: +1 AP every 3rd turn
- **Treasure Hunter**: See loot quality before opening
- **Tactical Mind**: See enemy AP and next action

#### Class Talents (Unlocked at specific levels)
- Level 10: Class specialization choice
- Level 20: Advanced class features
- Level 30: Master class abilities
- Level 40: Legendary transformations

### 5. Multiclassing System (Optional, Level 15+)

At level 15, players can choose to:
- **Specialize**: Double down on their class for powerful bonuses
- **Hybrid**: Pick a secondary class for versatility
- **Generalist**: Access to basic skills from all classes

Multiclass penalties:
- -20% XP gain
- Skills cost +1 point from other trees
- Can't access Tier 4 skills of secondary class

### 6. Prestige System (Post Level 50)

After reaching max level:
- **Prestige Levels**: Infinite progression with small stat bonuses
- **Paragon Points**: Special currency for unique upgrades
- **Legacy Skills**: Unlock skills from discovered legendary items
- **Champion Trials**: Extreme challenges for cosmetic rewards

## Dynamic Scaling

### Enemy Scaling
- Enemies scale with player level in certain areas
- Base enemy level + (Player Level * 0.3)
- Ensures challenge remains consistent
- Boss enemies don't scale (fixed challenges)

### Loot Scaling
- Item level = Enemy level ± 2
- Higher difficulty = better stat rolls
- Legendary items ignore level requirements

### XP Scaling
- Lower level enemies give reduced XP
- XP = Base XP * (1 - LevelDifference * 0.1)
- Minimum 10% XP to prevent grinding becoming pointless

## Visual Progression

- Level up fanfare with particle effects
- Stat increase animations
- Skill tree visualization with glowing paths
- Character model changes at milestone levels
- Achievement notifications for special accomplishments

Generate complete progression system with:
- Save/load compatible data structures
- Balanced stat formulas
- Clear visual feedback
- Tutorial integration
- Respec options (cost increases each use)
