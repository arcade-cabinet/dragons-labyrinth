# Generate Character System from Discovered Assets

## Context
You are implementing a character system for a hex-based 2.5D RPG in Godot 4. The game uses discovered 3D model assets to dynamically create character classes and enemy types.

## Discovered Character Assets
{% for character in discovered_characters %}
### {{ character.name }}
- File: {{ character.filename }}
- Theme: {{ character.theme }}
- Suggested Role: {{ character.role }}
{% endfor %}

## Requirements

### 1. Base Character Class (Character.gd)
Create a base character class that all entities inherit from:
- Health/Mana/Stamina system with regeneration
- Stats: Strength, Defense, Speed, Intelligence
- Movement on hex grid with animation
- Inventory system for equipment
- Skill/ability system
- Status effects (poison, stun, etc.)
- Line of sight calculation on hex grid

### 2. Dynamic Character Classes
For each discovered character asset, generate a unique class:
- Analyze the asset name/theme to determine appropriate abilities
- Create 2-3 unique skills per character type
- Balance stats based on apparent role (tank, DPS, support)
- Include special passive abilities that fit the theme

Example interpretations:
- "Knight" → High defense, shield abilities, protection skills
- "Alien" → Psychic powers, technology-based abilities
- "Pirate" → Mobility skills, treasure-finding bonuses
- "Robot" → Repair abilities, energy-based attacks

### 3. Character Controller
Implement smooth hex-based movement:
- Click/tap to move pathfinding
- Arrow keys (↑↓←→) for direct hex navigation
- WASD keys as alternative to arrow keys
- Numpad support for 6-directional hex movement
- Smooth interpolation between hexes
- Turn-based or real-time movement modes
- Animation state machine integration
- Visual feedback showing available movement directions

### 4. Character Factory
Create a factory system that:
- Loads character definitions from JSON/resource files
- Instantiates characters based on discovered assets
- Applies appropriate materials/textures
- Scales models to fit hex grid appropriately

## Visual Integration
- Model height: Approximately 1.5x hex width
- Camera angle: 45-degree top-down
- Shadows: Dynamic for depth perception
- Selection indicator: Glowing hex beneath character

## Stats Scaling
Generate balanced stats using these guidelines:
- Base health: 80-120 based on role
- Mana: 50-100 based on magic affinity
- Speed: 3-7 hexes per turn
- Ensure no character is overpowered
