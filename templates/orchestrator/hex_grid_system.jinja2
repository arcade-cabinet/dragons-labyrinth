# Generate Hex Grid System for Godot 4

## Context
You are creating a hexagonal grid system for a 2.5D top-down RPG game in Godot 4. The game displays 3D models from a fixed top-down camera angle on a hexagonal grid.

## Requirements

Create a complete hex grid system with the following components:

### 1. HexCoord.gd - Coordinate System
Generate a GDScript class that:
- Uses cube coordinates (q, r, s) where q + r + s = 0
- Converts between cube, offset, and pixel coordinates
- Calculates distances between hexes
- Finds neighbors in all 6 directions
- Supports pathfinding operations
- Handles hex-to-hex line drawing

### 2. HexGrid.gd - Grid Management
Generate a Node2D-based grid system that:
- Creates a grid of specified width/height
- Manages tile placement and removal
- Tracks entities on each hex
- Handles mouse/touch input for hex selection
- Supports grid visualization for debugging
- Manages fog of war/visibility

### 3. HexTile.gd - Individual Tile
Generate a tile class that:
- Displays the appropriate 3D model/sprite
- Handles multiple tile types (grass, stone, water, etc.)
- Supports height variations for terrain
- Manages tile state (walkable, blocked, etc.)
- Shows selection/hover highlights
- Handles smooth transitions between tile types

## Technical Specifications

- Hex size: 64 pixels (flat-top orientation)
- Grid storage: Dictionary with HexCoord as key
- Rendering: Use Godot's 2D system with 3D models
- Performance: Support grids up to 100x100 hexes

## Asset Integration

The system should dynamically load tile types based on discovered assets:
{% for tile in discovered_tiles %}
- {{ tile.name }}: {{ tile.description }}
{% endfor %}

## Visual Style
- Camera angle: 45-degree top-down view
- Hex orientation: Flat-top (pointy sides)
- Grid lines: Optional, togglable for debugging
- Highlighting: Subtle glow effect for selection

Generate complete, production-ready GDScript code with proper error handling and documentation.
