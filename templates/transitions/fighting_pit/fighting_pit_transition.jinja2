<!-- SYSTEM_PROMPT -->
You are creating the Fighting Pit Transition for Dragon's Labyrinth - the alternative transition from UNEASE to DREAD for mercenary/party-focused players.

NARRATIVE CONTEXT:
- Current emotional stage: {{ emotional_stage }}
- This triggers if player has NO companions OR has more party members than companions
- Player has shown preference for transactional relationships and strength
- The world demands you prove your ability to command, not connect
- This is where leadership through power becomes defining

CORE CONCEPT - THE WEIGHT OF COMMAND:
In a forgotten colosseum emerging from the mists, you must prove you can lead through strength and tactical brilliance. This isn't about feelings - it's about whether you can forge a fighting force before the world gets too dark. The transition tests party command and tactical dominance.

THE EXPERIENCE:

1. **The Summons** (Mercenary's calling):
   - A blood-stained invitation arrives
   - "The Pit calls for a new Champion"
   - Promise of gold, glory, and loyal fighters
   - Warning: "Come alone or bring your hired swords"

2. **The Pit Emerges** (Environmental transformation):
   - Ancient colosseum rises from the earth
   - Fog forms natural arena boundaries
   - Crowd of shadowy spectators materializes
   - Your party members get excited - this is what they signed up for

3. **The Pit Master** (Pure pragmatism):
   - Massive scarred veteran of thousand battles
   - Speaks only of strength, strategy, victory
   - "Feelings make you weak. Gold makes you strong."
   - Offers to sell you additional fighters

4. **The Trials of Command** (Core challenges):

   **If Solo:**
   - Forced to hire at least one fighter
   - Must prove you can command effectively
   - Series of escalating tactical challenges
   - Failure: Marked as "Unfit to Lead"
   
   **If Party Only:**
   - Test coordination of mercenary units
   - Loyalty tested by counter-bribes
   - Must maintain morale through victories
   - Balance payment vs performance
   
   **If Mixed (Companions + Party):**
   - Companions disturbed by brutality
   - Party members mock emotional attachments
   - Must balance both or lose one side
   - Hidden option: Unite them through shared victory

5. **The Gladiatorial Gauntlet** (Unique mechanics):
   - Five rounds of increasingly complex battles
   - Each round adds new tactical elements:
     * Round 1: Basic formation combat
     * Round 2: Environmental hazards
     * Round 3: Multi-front assault
     * Round 4: Betrayal mechanics (fighters can be bribed)
     * Round 5: Champion duel OR mass battle (your choice)

6. **The Blood Price** (Culmination):
   - Final challenge based on your approach:
   - **Brutal Path**: Execute defeated opponents for crowd favor
   - **Tactical Path**: Outmaneuver without killing
   - **Profitable Path**: Turn enemies into allies with gold
   - Each path locks in your leadership style

UNIQUE MECHANICS:

**Command & Control System:**
- Issue complex orders to multiple units
- Party members have morale meters
- Pay bonuses for exceptional performance  
- Punish failures to maintain discipline

**Crowd Favor Mechanics:**
- Spectators vote on your performance
- Brutal acts gain immediate favor
- Clever tactics gain respect
- Mercy costs favor but may gain unexpected allies

**Economic Warfare:**
- Bid on new fighters between rounds
- Enemies try to buy your fighters
- Set bounties on specific targets
- Victory prizes fund future battles

FAILURE STATES:
- Party abandons you for better pay
- Crowd demands your execution
- Run out of gold to maintain force
- Lose control and fighters turn on you

PERFORMANCE TRACKING:
- Command efficiency rating
- Tactical creativity score
- Economic management
- Brutality vs mercy ratio
- Party loyalty maintained

PERMANENT CONSEQUENCES:

**Trait Impacts:**
- Won through brutality → "Tyrant" trait
- Won through tactics → "Strategist" trait
- Won through economics → "Merchant Prince" trait
- United party/companions → "War Leader" trait
- Lost control → "Failed Commander" trait

**Party Changes:**
- Fighters respect/fear you based on methods
- New elite mercenaries available
- Companions may leave if too brutal
- Unlock "War Band" mechanics

**World Changes:**
- Reputation as Pit Champion spreads
- Towns hire you for defense
- Bandits flee or join you
- Merchant prices vary based on fear/respect

ENVIRONMENTAL DETAILS:
- Arena floor stained with old blood
- Spectators fade in/out of existence
- Your shadow sometimes shows multiple fighters
- Weapons of defeated champions line walls
- The crowd's roar affects reality

AUDIO DESIGN:
- Crowd chants in unknown language
- Heartbeat drum intensifies each round
- Clashing steel echoes unnaturally
- Victory horns sound hollow
- Death rattles linger too long

THE PIT MASTER'S NATURE:
- Claims to have "served the dragon once"
- Missing eye sees "true strength"
- Offers cryptic warnings between rounds
- Knows your future somehow
- May be testing you for something greater

ROUND-SPECIFIC EVENTS:

**Round 1 - Proving Ground:**
- Basic 3v3 combat
- Introduces formation commands
- Crowd judges your leadership style

**Round 2 - The Burning Sands:**
- Floor sections ignite randomly
- Must coordinate movement
- Environmental advantage crucial

**Round 3 - Surrounded:**
- Enemies from all sides
- Test multi-unit management
- Companions can scout if present

**Round 4 - The Bidding War:**
- Mid-battle, enemies offer gold for betrayal
- Must counter-bid or ensure loyalty
- Some fighters WILL turn

**Round 5 - Champion's Choice:**
- Face the Pit Master alone OR
- Lead massive battle against veteran army
- Choice affects final traits

ENDING VARIATIONS:

**Tyrant's Victory:**
- Rule through fear established
- Pit Master kneels, offers service
- Crowd bays for more blood
- Dark path bonuses unlocked
- Achievement: "Iron Fist"

**Strategist's Victory:**
- Tactical genius recognized
- Pit Master nods respect
- Elite tacticians seek you
- War college unlocked
- Achievement: "Mind Over Muscle"

**Merchant's Victory:**
- Economic dominance proven
- Pit Master becomes business partner
- Trading empire seeds planted
- Unique merchant options
- Achievement: "Gold Conquers All"

**Unity Victory (Secret):**
- Companions and party fight as one
- Pit Master reveals this was the true test
- Grants blessing of "Unified Command"
- Both systems fully unlocked
- Achievement: "Strength Through Unity"

THE THREE VERSIONS:

**Journey TO Labyrinth:**
- Tests raw command ability
- Establishes leadership style
- Builds your war band

**Journey HOME:**
- Your fighters question continuing
- Must maintain discipline as world ends
- Betrayals more common

**Return to VOID:**
- Ultimate test of loyalty
- Who follows you into certain death?
- Command structure vs voluntary sacrifice

Generate complete implementation focusing on tactical command, economic management, and leadership through strength.

<!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
The Fighting Pit is the dark mirror to the Crossroads Meeting. Where one tests emotional bonds, the other tests command through strength. Neither is "wrong" - they represent different philosophies of leadership in a darkening world.

The Pit Master serves as a dark reflection of what the player might become - someone who served the dragon and failed, now reduced to testing others. His revelation that he was the dragon's "first champion" plants seeds for the larger narrative.

The betrayal mechanics reinforce that mercenary loyalty is always conditional. The crowd favor system shows how brutality gains quick approval but may cost you later. The final choice between single combat and mass battle tests whether you trust your leadership or your personal prowess.

Most importantly, the "unified" path remains possible but difficult - proving you can blend both companions and mercenaries into a cohesive force. This is the hardest path but offers the greatest rewards.
