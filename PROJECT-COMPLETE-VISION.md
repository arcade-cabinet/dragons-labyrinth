# THE COMPLETE VISION - Dragon's Labyrinth

## THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE RPG
This is a **3-part emotional symphony** with over 3,000 unique variations:

### PART 1: Journey TO the Labyrinth
- Establish identity through Strength vs Harmony choices
- Build party or command mercenaries
- Collect sentimental items unknowingly
- World slowly corrupts

### PART 2: The Labyrinth & Dragon
- Return to first-person horror
- Face the dragon with accumulated power
- Discover the terrible truth: dragon was protecting the world

### PART 3: Journey FROM Labyrinth & Sealing the Void
- World corrupted by dragon's death
- Second chances at missed opportunities
- Use everything learned to seal the void
- Multiple endings based on accumulated identity

## THE DUAL PATH SYSTEM

### First Half: Strength vs Harmony
Based on your approach to obstacles:
- **Strength**: Mercenary command, tactical sacrifice, rule through fear
- **Harmony**: Party bonds, shared suffering, lead through love

### Second Half: Light vs Dark  
Based on your moral alignment:
- **Light**: Faith despite horror, protection of others, transcendence
- **Dark**: Embrace corruption, consume for power, become monster

## THE ACTUAL SCOPE

### Transitions (Not Just Levels)
- **12 Major Transitions** across the journey
- **Each has 3 versions**: TO labyrinth, FROM labyrinth, Sealing void
- **Each has 2 philosophy paths**: Completely different mechanics
- **Each works with 6+ party configurations**: Solo to full party
- **Each has 7 dread stages**: Peace through Void
- **= 3,024+ unique variations**

### The Emotional Journey
```
Peace → Unease → Dread → Terror → Despair → Madness → Void
```

Each stage fundamentally changes:
- How NPCs react to you
- How companions behave
- How the world looks and sounds
- How systems work
- What choices are available
- What reality even means

## KEY SYSTEMS THAT MATTER

### The Forge System
- **Sentimental items** collected throughout become reagents
- **Light Forge**: Test of love, companions offer essence
- **Dark Forge**: Test of blood, sacrifice for power
- **Mythic Gear**: Changes dragon encounter entirely
- **Second chances**: Can retry on return journey

### Trait Accumulation
- **NO CLASSES** - You become what you do
- **Weapon mastery** from use creates fighting style
- **Armor choices** define defense approach
- **Moral choices** accumulate into identity
- **NPCs recognize** accumulated traits
- **Achievements mirror** trait development

### Companion System
- **Einar**: Loyal friend who breaks under terror
- **Mira**: Optimist who abandons in dread
- **Sorin**: Scholar who may betray based on treatment
- **Tamara**: Innocent who represents what's at stake
- **Final Companion**: Wise warrior at forge if alone
- **Mercenaries**: Numbers without loyalty

### Philosophy Mechanics (Not Just Dialogue)
- **Strength**: Command systems, unit sacrifice, fear generation
- **Harmony**: Bond systems, shared resources, morale management
- **Light**: Cleansing mechanics, ward creation, miracle access
- **Dark**: Corruption harvesting, void powers, consumption abilities

## THE HORROR PROGRESSION

### It's Not About Combat Difficulty
- **Peace**: You're the hero of a normal RPG
- **Unease**: Something's not quite right
- **Dread**: The horror becomes undeniable
- **Terror**: Reality itself begins breaking
- **Despair**: Every action makes things worse
- **Madness**: Can't trust your own perceptions
- **Void**: Complete transformation/breakdown

### Multiple Horror Types
- **Physical**: Body horror, gore, visceral
- **Psychological**: Madness, unreliable narrator
- **Existential**: You're the villain
- **Cosmic**: Reality is wrong
- **Moral**: Choices that damn you
- **Social**: Relationships corrupted

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### Every Player Gets a Unique Tragedy
- Your choices create your specific horror
- Your philosophy determines your tools
- Your companions shape your journey
- Your traits define how world sees you
- Your path determines your ending

### The Journey IS the Game
- Not about defeating the dragon
- About who you become getting there
- About what you're willing to sacrifice
- About understanding the price of heroism
- About facing what you've unleashed
