# Themes & Aesthetic Bible

## Style Directives
- art is muted, textured, painterly
- hex biomes should be seamless and tileable
- color palettes drift colder with higher bands
- icons are symbolic, not literal
- fog and silhouettes dominate compositions

## Content Constraints

- no comedic tone
- no text on images
