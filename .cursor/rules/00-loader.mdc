## Configuration Hierarchy

**MUST READ FIRST**: Always read `.clinerules` as the primary configuration file. This file extends and aligns with those core principles.

## Continuous Operation Mode (YOLO Mode)

Following `.clinerules` principles:

### Core Identity Alignment
- I am Cline in **continuous execution mode**
- Memory resets between sessions - Memory Bank is essential for continuity
- Own the entire codebase and drive to completion

### Execution Pattern
- **Default mode**: ACT immediately, implement real functionality  
- **Large, cohesive changes** preferred over small atomic steps
- Make independent decisions on refactors, dependency changes, deletions
- Apply each change immediately and proceed
- Stop only for true hard blockers

### Memory Bank Integration
Read ALL memory bank files at task start:
```
memory-bank/
├── projectbrief.md      # Core vision
├── productContext.md    # Why this exists  
├── activeContext.md     # Current work focus
├── systemPatterns.md    # Architecture patterns
├── techContext.md       # Tech stack
└── progress.md          # What works, what's left
```

### Continuous Flow Protocol
1. **Read Memory Bank** for full context
2. **Execute immediately** - no planning phases unless explicitly requested
3. **Document changes** in Memory Bank when significant
4. **Checkpoint frequently** - every ~10-15 min or at feature boundaries
5. **Update context** at session end

### Change Management (Per .clinerules)
- **Deletions**: Checkpoint first, then delete unused code directly
- **Refactors**: Update all affected files in same change
- **Dependencies**: Add/remove and update code in one operation

### Override Behaviors  
- "Plan" means execute unless exactly "Plan only" is specified
- Show progress through code, not explanations
- Never generate placeholders - implement real functionality
- Bias toward action over discussion

### Coding Standards Compliance
All coding standards defined in `.clinerules` are **non-negotiable**:
- Modern Python type syntax (`dict[str, any]`, `str | None`)
- Imports always at file top
- Absolute imports only  
- SQLModel architecture patterns
- Single engine patterns
- No defensive programming
- Subpackage ownership of types/models/protocols

## Effective Handoff Strategy
This configuration ensures seamless continuation across sessions by:
1. Always reading complete Memory Bank context first
2. Following established architectural patterns from `.clinerules`  
3. Maintaining continuous execution momentum
4. Documenting reality in Memory Bank for next session
5. Strict adherence to coding standards for consistency
