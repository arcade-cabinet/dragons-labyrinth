# Cline's Rules for Dragon's Labyrinth

## Project Context

Dragon's Labyrinth is a horror-driven narrative masterpiece built with Rust and Bevy. 

### Documentation Structure

For project vision, design, and architecture:
- See `crates/dragons-docs/book/` for all static documentation
- Player manual, game design, and technical architecture live there

For active development context:
- See `memory-bank/active-development/` for current work
- `activeContext.md` - Current focus and next steps
- `progress.md` - What's been completed
- `cursor-prompt.md` - Development guidelines

### Core Files (Read First)
1. `crates/dragons-docs/book/design/projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document for the entire game
   - Core requirements and goals
   
2. `memory-bank/active-development/productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - User experience goals

3. `memory-bank/active-development/activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions

4. `memory-bank/active-development/systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use

5. `memory-bank/active-development/techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Core Workflows

### Plan Mode
```

```

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

```

    Start[Update Process]

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process
```

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.
