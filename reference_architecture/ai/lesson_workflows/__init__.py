"""
Educational lesson workflows.

These workflows implement the 4-phase educational progression:
- Phase 1: Arcade Quick Wins (zero boilerplate, fast feedback)
- Phase 2: Pygame Fundamentals (explicit loops, closer to metal)  
- Phase 3: PySDL2 Behind Curtain (low-level graphics and input)
- Phase 4: Software Engineering (architecture, patterns, engineering)

Lesson workflows compile to actual lesson code and student projects.
