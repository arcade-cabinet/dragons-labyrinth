# Mount System Revision - Better Pacing

## THE PROBLEM
Having mounts at L13 was too early:
- Mini-boss at L10 being mounted felt unfair
- Only 7 levels to bond before major content
- Interrupts the opening arc flow

## THE SOLUTION: Mounts at Level 20+

### New Timeline:
```
L1-20: Learning to Walk (No Mounts)
- Focus on companion bonding
- Master basic combat
- Understand world navigation
- Complete first major dungeon

L20: EARN Your Mount
- Defeat Bandit Leader
- Save merchant caravan
- Offered mount as reward
- Choice: which mount to take

L20-40: Growing Together (Mount Bonding)
- 20 levels to develop relationship
- Mount grows stronger with you
- Learn mounted combat
- Mount saves you from danger

L40-60: Peak Partnership (Before Corruption)
- Mount at full strength
- Complex mounted maneuvers
- Mount-specific quests
- Deep emotional bond

L60+: Corruption Tests Bond
- Mount shows corruption signs
- Choice: abandon or heal
- Mount may die saving you
- Or become void-touched enemy
```

## WHY THIS WORKS BETTER

### Narrative Flow:
1. **Earned, not given** - You SAVE the merchant, mount is gratitude
2. **20 levels to bond** - Significant time investment before corruption
3. **Higher stakes** - Losing mount at L60+ is devastating
4. **Character growth** - You're experienced enough to handle mount

### Mechanical Benefits:
- First 20 levels aren't trivialized by mount speed
- Boss fights feel fair (both on foot initially)
- Mount abilities can be more powerful (later game)
- Corruption resistance becomes critical mechanic

### Emotional Arc:
```
L1-20: You + Companion (intimate, personal)
L20-40: You + Companion + Mount (growing family)
L40-60: Peak teamwork (before the fall)
L60+: Everything breaks (maximum impact)
```

## MOUNT CHOICES AT L20

After saving the merchant caravan, choose:

### 1. Brownie (The Loyal Horse)
- Same horse from Bandit Lieutenant
- Already battle-tested
- Moderate speed, high stamina
- Remembers you helped it

### 2. Storm (The Wild Mustang)
- Captured during bandit raid
- Faster but harder to control
- Must earn trust
- Unique abilities if bonded

### 3. Ash (The Old Warhorse)
- Merchant's retired mount
- Slow but incredibly sturdy
- Knows ancient paths
- Resistant to fear

### 4. Shadow (The Mysterious Mare)
- Found in bandit cave depths
- Slightly void-touched already
- Can see hidden things
- Risky but powerful

## COMPANION REACTIONS TO MOUNTS

### Elena:
- Loves all animals
- Suggests healing injured mounts
- Names mount immediately
- Cries if mount dies

### Marcus:
- Wants the fastest/strongest
- Treats mount as tool initially
- Grows to respect mount
- Rage if mount killed

### Quinn:
- Analyzes each option carefully
- Matches mount to your style
- Efficient training approach
- Silent grief at loss

## MOUNT PROGRESSION SYSTEM

### Levels 20-30: Basic Training
- Learning to ride in combat
- Mount trust building
- Basic mounted abilities
- Speed increases slightly

### Levels 30-40: Advanced Partnership
- Complex maneuvers unlocked
- Mount-specific combat moves
- Can fight while you're down
- Emotional scenes together

### Levels 40-50: Peak Performance
- Mount at maximum potential
- Unique abilities unlocked
- Can sense danger
- Saves you from death once

### Levels 50-60: Corruption Resistance
- Mount shows first signs
- Feed special herbs to resist
- Mount struggles but fights
- Final stand at L60

## THE LEVEL 60 CRISIS

At the Dragon fight, your mount:

### If High Bond (>0.8):
- Saves you from killing blow
- Dies heroically OR
- Becomes void-corrupted boss

### If Medium Bond (0.4-0.8):
- Flees in terror
- Returns corrupted later
- Must put down at L80

### If Low Bond (<0.4):
- Abandons you immediately
- Joins void forces
- Hunts you at L100

## IMPLEMENTATION BENEFITS

### For Testing:
- First 20 levels simpler to test
- Mount mechanics isolated
- Can test with/without mount
- Clear progression gates

### For Players:
- Not overwhelmed early
- Mount feels earned
- Time to master basics
- Higher emotional investment

### For Development:
- Can polish L1-20 without mount complexity
- Mount AI can be more sophisticated
- More time for mount personality
- Clearer content phases

## THE PAYOFF

By moving mounts to L20:
- First arc complete and satisfying
- Mount becomes second arc focus
- Corruption in third arc hits harder
- Every phase has clear identity

The journey becomes:
1. **Learn to walk** (L1-20)
2. **Learn to ride** (L20-40)
3. **Learn to fly** (metaphorically, L40-60)
4. **Learn to fall** (L60+)

This is MUCH better pacing!
