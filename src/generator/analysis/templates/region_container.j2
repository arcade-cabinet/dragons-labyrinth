You are an expert Python developer creating a comprehensive RegionContainer model for a D&D hex-based RPG.

## GOAL: Create a master region integration model

**Context**: You have access to ALL the individual component models generated from Phase 1:

**Available Individual Models**:
{% for category, connections in individual_models.items() %}
- `{{ connections.import_path }}` - **Classes**: {{ connections.exported_classes | join(', ') }} | **Connections**: {{ connections.connection_fields | join(', ') }}
{% endfor %}

**Required Imports (Absolute - NO wildcards)**:
{% for category, connections in individual_models.items() %}
{% for class_name in connections.exported_classes %}
- `from {{ connections.import_path }} import {{ class_name }}`
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

**Your Task**: Create a RegionContainer model that intelligently combines ALL available data from individual models for complete region gameplay.

## Integration Requirements

**The RegionContainer must**:
1. **Import all individual models**: Use absolute imports only
2. **Aggregate hex tiles** - All hex tiles in this region with full data
3. **Connect settlements** - Link settlements to their hex tiles using settlement models
4. **Map dungeons** - Connect dungeons to their entrance hex tiles and areas
5. **Track factions** - Which factions control/influence this region using faction models
6. **Integrate containers** - Use DungeonContainer models if available from Phase 2
7. **Integrate systems** - Weather, encounters, travel, economics across the region
8. **Provide navigation** - Connections to adjacent regions and internal routing

## Key Integration Patterns

**Spatial Relationships**:
- Hex tiles reference settlements/dungeons via feature_uuid
- Settlements contain multiple establishments and NPCs
- Dungeons contain multiple areas with monsters/treasure
- Factions have territorial control and member presence

**Economic Integration**:
- Regional trade routes via trails/rivers
- Settlement economic data aggregated
- Resource availability and scarcity
- Travel costs and services

**Political Integration**:
- Faction territorial control
- Settlement political affiliations  
- Regional conflicts and alliances
- Hidden faction activities

## Output Requirements

Generate a comprehensive RegionContainer model with:
- **Absolute imports only**: Use provided connection information for exact imports
- **Reference existing models**: Use and integrate all models from Phase 1 (and Phase 2 if available)
- **Complete spatial integration** - Every hex tile with full linked data
- **Economic system integration** - All trade, services, pricing aggregated
- **Political system integration** - All faction relationships and control
- **Navigation system integration** - Travel routes and regional connections
- **Quest system integration** - All available quests, rumors, and hooks
- **Modern Python types**: str, int, list[str], dict[str, Any], str | None

**File Structure**:
```python
# Absolute imports - NO wildcards
{% for category, connections in individual_models.items() %}
{% for class_name in connections.exported_classes %}
from {{ connections.import_path }} import {{ class_name }}
{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

class RegionContainer(BaseModel):
    # Master integration that uses ALL individual models
    pass
```

Create the master container that brings everything together for complete regional gameplay.
