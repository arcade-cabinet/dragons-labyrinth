# Edgar Allan Poe - Curated Horror Excerpts

THE RAVEN
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

THE TELL-TALE HEART
True!—nervous—very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?
The disease had sharpened my senses—not destroyed—not dulled them.

THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER
During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country.

Quest Patterns from Poe:
- Investigation: mysterious sounds, hidden secrets, guilty conscience
- Revelation: truth emerges through obsession and madness
- Confrontation: face the horror within oneself
- Themes: guilt, paranoia, decay, hidden knowledge
