# Getting Started

Welcome to Dragon's Labyrinth, a horror-driven narrative experience that evolves with your fear.

## What is Dragon's Labyrinth?

Dragon's Labyrinth is not just a game—it's a psychological journey through trauma, companionship, and the price of second chances. As you navigate a hex-based world with your damaged companions, every decision reshapes both the narrative and the very fabric of reality around you.

## Core Experience

### The Dread System
Your emotional state drives everything. From 0 (unease) to 4 (pure horror), the game transforms:
- **UI degrades** with your sanity
- **Audio distorts** to match your fear
- **Companions reveal** their true trauma
- **The world itself corrupts** around you

### Your Companions
You don't adventure alone. Each companion carries their own psychological scars:
- **The Therapist** - Professional distance hiding personal demons
- **The Child** - Innocence corrupted by what they've witnessed
- **The Medic** - Healing others while unable to heal themselves
- **The Scholar** - Knowledge that brings madness

### The Forge
A revolutionary trial system where you sacrifice parts of yourself:
- Trade memories for power
- Forge bonds through shared trauma
- Create sentimental reagents from loss
- Face trials that test your humanity

## First Steps

1. **Choose Your Save Slot** - Three parallel realities await
2. **Meet Your First Companion** - They need you as much as you need them
3. **Experience the Hex Board** - A living world that responds to dread
4. **Face Your First Choice** - There are no right answers, only consequences

## What Makes This Different

- **No Combat System** - Violence isn't the answer to trauma
- **Narrative-Driven Progression** - Your story shapes your abilities
- **Procedural Horror** - AI-generated content ensures unique terror
- **Companion Psychology** - Deep, reactive relationship systems
- **Environmental Storytelling** - The world decays with your sanity

## Controls

### Hex Movement

## Tips for New Players

> **Remember**: This is a game about the journey, not the destination.

- Pay attention to companion reactions
- Environmental changes hint at dread progression  
- The Forge isn't mandatory, but transformation has a price
- Save points are emotional checkpoints, not just data
- Trust is harder to rebuild than to maintain

## Ready?

Your companions are waiting. The labyrinth beckons. The only question is: how much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice for a second chance?
