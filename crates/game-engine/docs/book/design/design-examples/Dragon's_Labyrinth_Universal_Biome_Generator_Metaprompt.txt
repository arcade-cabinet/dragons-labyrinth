## INTEGRATION WITH DRAGON'S LABYRINTH GENERATOR

This metaprompt system can replace the existing asset libraries by:

1. **Batch Generation**: Generate complete biome sets (20-50 tiles per biome)
2. **Automatic Integration**: Generate corresponding GDScript libraries
3. **Procedural Variation**: Create 3-5 variants per biome type
4. **Transition Sets**: Generate edge pieces for smooth biome blending
5. **Special Tiles**: Create unique landmark/event tiles for each biome

The generator can then use these AI-created models instead of purchased assets, maintaining the same sophisticated asset library system while having complete creative control over the visual style and ensuring perfect integration with the hex-based gameplay mechanics.
