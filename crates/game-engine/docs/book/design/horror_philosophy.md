# Dragon's Labyrinth - Comprehensive Master Synthesis
## DEPRECATED - REPLACED BY enhanced-comprehensive-synthesis.md

**⚠️ CRITICAL NOTICE: This document has been deprecated and replaced.**

**Reason**: This synthesis incorrectly treated sophisticated systems (Dual Forge, 4-Path Philosophy, Companion Trauma) as "expansions" when they are **core systems** from the original design.

**Replacement Document**: `memory-bank/master-plan/enhanced-comprehensive-synthesis.md`

**Key Corrections Made**:
1. **Dual Forge System**: Not a "+2 weeks expansion" - it's the **ultimate endgame test**
2. **Sentimental Items**: Not a "+1 week expansion" - it's the **reagent collection system** spanning the entire game
3. **4-Path Philosophy**: Not mentioned - but it's the **core identity framework** with 12 transitions
4. **Agent Count**: Not 5 agents - requires **11 specialized agents** for complete vision
5. **Architecture Balance**: Only addressed assets - missed **Core Code vs Prompt Generation** balance

**User Feedback**: 
> "The issue with doing BOTH a complete review AND in depth review at the same time is they are technically TWO separate kinds of reviews so now that you have finished this more general one I believe we should as a sanity check now VERY thoroughly review EVERY design direction I provided in the original larger vision"

This document failed the thorough review test by oversimplifying complex systems.

**Migration Path**:
- Read `memory-bank/master-plan/enhanced-comprehensive-synthesis.md` for corrected vision
- Read `memory-bank/vision-integration/balanced-architecture-plan.md` for MCP integration
- Read `memory-bank/task-delegation/enhanced-agent-tasks.md` for 11-agent architecture

**DO NOT USE THIS DOCUMENT FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
